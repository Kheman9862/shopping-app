## About Application

This is the shoping app built as a mobile application using react-native and expo as a wrapper to the native code. To store all of the data i have used web database firebase and for authetication i have used the microservices of firebase which not only help in log in but also to crate new account which will be stored in the database.

It also consists of a form page where a user person can add a new item or edit the existing one and then the changes will be represented to everyone. Or say it is a CRUD native application.
